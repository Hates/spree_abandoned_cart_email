#SpreeAbandonedCartEmail

Abandoned cart email extension. Looks for orders with line items that were created over 12 hours ago and gives them a nudge to complete.

Use the config values below to change settings:

```
Spree::AbandonedCartEmailConfig::Config.email_timeframe = 12.hours
Spree::AbandonedCartEmailConfig::Config.email_from = "spree@example.com"
```

Override the email view to customise:

```
app/views/spree/abandoned_cart_mailer/abandoned_email.html.erb
```

Create a rake task to send the email:

```
desc "Abandoned cart emails"
task send_abandond_cart_emails: :environment do
  Spree::Order.self.email_eligible_abandoned_email_orders
end
```
Create a cronjob to run every so often to send the emails:

```
0 * * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'cd {your_application_home} && RAILS_ENV=production rake send_abandoned_cart_emails 2>&1'
```
